description: "\nThe work presented in \\cite{Yang2018DenseAT} introduces two datasets\
  \ for Chinese character detection and recognition, the Tripitaka Koreana in Han\
  \ (TKH) and the Multiple Tripitaka in Han (MTH), created using the publicly available\
  \ TKH images from the Tripitaka Koreana Institute.\n%The images were annotated by\
  \ detecting the text lines and then segmenting them using beam-search to obtain\
  \ the bounding box annotations.\nFor every character bounding box that the dataset\
  \ includes, a character label was further provided.\nThe TKH consists of 1K pages,\
  \ 23,471 lines, 323,491 characters, and 1,471 character classes, while the MTH contains\
  \ 500 images, 17,178 lines, 197,886 characters, and 3,664 character classes.\nThe\
  \ two datasets differ in terms of challenge, as the MTH dataset has a more complex\
  \ character size uniformity, making the creation of bounding box annotations even\
  \ harder.\nA three-part pipeline called Recognition Guided Detector (RGD) was proposed.\
  \ \nFirst, segmentation is performed for every line. \nA Recognition Guided Proposal\
  \ Network (RGPN) generates context information, and finally, a detector uses that\
  \ information to find the characters in every line.\nFinally, several experiments\
  \ were performed on the two datasets using the proposed system with and without\
  \ a VGG-16 \\cite{Simonyan2015VeryDC} backbone and its performance was compared\
  \ with other well-known object detection frameworks using either the whole image\
  \ or text lines as input.\nThis method seems to perform comparably to other methods\
  \ using fewer parameters."
