description: '

  DocExplore \cite{10.1117/1.JEI.26.1.011010} is a pattern spotting dataset that contains
  1.5K images with more than 1.4K queries.

  The images originate from 6 different manuscripts written between the \nth{10} and
  \nth{16} centuries.

  The annotation process ends with 1,464 labeled objects belonging to 35 graphical
  object categories, where one sample constitutes the query image and the remaining
  objects from every category avail as retrieval outcomes.

  The dataset was proposed for two tasks: image retrieval and pattern localization.

  As baseline for the latter task a system that consists of an offline, online, and
  post-processing step initially presented in \cite{EN2016149} is used.

  In the offline step, the background is removed, a descriptor is used to find the
  object regions of interest, and finally a \ac{VLAD} is created.

  Then, during the online step, a similarity distance calculation is performed between
  the extracted regions and the query image, then ranking was achieved through template
  matching.

  The system achieved a 0.613 \ac{mAP} for retrieval and a 0.111 for localization,
  while further results on each category were shown.'
