description: '

  OBC306 \cite{8978032} is a dataset of 309,551 images for Oracle Bone character recognition
  distributed across 306 character classes.

  This dataset consists of patch samples derived from different sources from full
  image publications of oracle bones.

  For patch extraction, an oracle bone character list and dictionary were used to
  retrieve all characters and extract them from the source images to assign them to
  a class and a specific encoding.

  The challenges faced in the dataset are the class imbalance and the numerous variants
  of each character.

  The evaluation results of widely used \ac{CNN} architectures \cite{He2016DeepRL,
  Simonyan2015VeryDC, NIPS2012_c399862d, 7298594}, and a classical method of HOG descriptors
  with SVM \cite{1467360} were presented, and Inception-v4 \cite{7298594} achieved
  the best performance.

  Although the dataset is hand carved, we characterize it as handwritten in Table
  \ref{tab:structure_content_class} for homogeneity reasons. '
