    abstract = "Layout analysis and optical character recognition have become traditional tasks for processing historical prints, but are now insufficient. Additional information is found in typographic emphasis, such as bold and italic letters. They carry semantic meaning (titles, emphasis...) and also outline the structure of the page (entries, sub-parts...). Retrieving such data is therefore crucial for information extraction and automatic document structuring. In this paper, we introduce the Bold-Italic-Regular (BIR) database, which contains 285 pages of scanned, list-like historical prints that have been annotated at word level with bold and italic emphasis. Baseline results are provided for word detection and style classification using state-of-the-art deep neural network models, highlighting promising possibilities, such as near-human performance for isolated word classification, but also demonstrating limitations for the task at hand.",

    abstract = "This competition investigated the performance of historical document classification. The analysis of historical documents is a difficult challenge commonly solved by trained humanists. We provided three different classification tasks, which can be solved individually or jointly: font group/script type, location, date. The document images are provided by several institutions and are taken from handwritten and printed books as well as from charters. In contrast to previous competitions, all participants relied upon Deep Learning based approaches. Nevertheless, we saw a great performance variety of the different submitted systems. The easiest task seemed to be font group recognition while the script type classification and location classification were more challenging. In the dating task, the best system achieved a mean absolute error of about 22 years.",

    abstract = "This paper describes a system prepared at Brno University of Technology for ICDAR 2021 Competition on Historical Document Classification, experiments leading to its design, and the main findings. The solved tasks include script and font classification, document origin localization, and dating. We combined patch-level and line-level approaches, where the line-level system utilizes an existing, publicly available page layout analysis engine. In both systems, neural networks provide local predictions which are combined into page-level decisions, and the results of both systems are fused using linear or log-linear interpolation. We propose loss functions suitable for weakly supervised classification problem where multiple possible labels are provided, and we propose loss functions suitable for interval regression in the dating task. The line-level system significantly improves results in script and font classification and in the dating task. The full system achieved 98.48{\\%}, 88.84{\\%}, and 79.69{\\%} accuracy in the font, script, and location classification tasks respectively. In the dating task, our system achieved a mean absolute error of 21.91 years. Our system achieved the best results in all tasks and became the overall winner of the competition.",
