description: '

  The RODRIGO database \cite{serrano-etal-2010-rodrigo} contains data derived from
  a manuscript written in 1545 in old Castilian by one writer.

  The database follows a similar strategy as the GERMANA database in creation, ground
  truth, and experimental baseline.

  It includes 853-page images of one column text blocks, where each block is annotated
  with a bounding rectangle, and then each line within it with the corresponding baseline.

  The annotations further include transcriptions for every line, which results in
  a total of 20,357 text lines and 231K words as ground truth.

  Baseline results were provided for the task of handwriting recognition using the
  same model and processes as in Section \ref{sssec:germana}, by using 20 blocks of
  1K lines, and a \ac{WER} of 36.5\% was achieved on the last block. '
