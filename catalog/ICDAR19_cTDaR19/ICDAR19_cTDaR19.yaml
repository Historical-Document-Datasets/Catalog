description: "\nThe cTDaR competition of 2019 \\cite{8978120} held two tracks, Track\
  \ A for table region detection and Track B for table recognition, and two datasets,\
  \ modern and historical.\nThe historical document dataset includes civil records\
  \ containing various handwritten tables sourced from 23 different institutions.\n\
  For the table detection track, the dataset provides 600 training and 199 test images.\n\
  The table recognition track provides 600 training and 150 test samples for two subtracks:\
  \ B1, which provides the tables regions, and B2, which does not provide any a priori\
  \ knowledge. \nHence, there is a need for both region and structure detection for\
  \ B2. \nThe results from 11 teams for track A and two teams for track B were compared.\
  \ \nThe winning team for track A achieved a \\ac{WA} F1 score of 0.94 for the historical\
  \ documents by using a classifier to categorize modern and archive samples and Faster-RCNN\
  \ \\cite{NIPS2015_14bfa6bb} for table detection. \nThen, they merged the overlapping\
  \ regions that exceeded a given threshold value.\nFor the second track, the best\
  \ submission achieved a \\ac{WA} F1 of 0.48 for B1 and 0.47 for B2. \nAn \\ac{FCN}\
  \ was used to obtain the tables' guiding lines and junction points for broken line\
  \ repair.\nThen, the cells were extracted through Connected Component Analysis and\
  \ the row and column range were handled through a neighbor graph."
