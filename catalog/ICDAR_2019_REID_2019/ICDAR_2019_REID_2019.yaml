description: '

  The REID2019 competition \cite{8978191} is an extension of the previously mentioned
  REID2017 competition (Section \ref{sssec:reid2017}).

  This competition provided 25 labeled images with the same annotation format and
  content as the previous competition and a balanced test set of 56 images written
  in English and Bengali.

  %The organizers of the competition provide the image annotations in PAGE XML format
  cretaed using Aletheia.

  %These annotations include layout region polygons, metadata such as heading, paragraph,
  captions, footer, etc, and reading order information.

  This competition hosted two tasks, layout analysis and text recognition, but focused
  mostly on Bengali text recognition.

  Again, the Google Multilingual \ac{OCR} achieved the highest flex \ac{ca} in the
  text recognition task and success rate in the text region page segmentation.

  The results from this competition were slightly better than those in 2017 but still
  remain quite low, and the authors suggested a focus on preprocessing for better
  performance.'
