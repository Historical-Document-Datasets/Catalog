description: "\nIn \\cite{9257750}, a corpus for automatic manuscript transcription\
  \ was presented. \nThis dataset contains 1K pages from early modern Dutch manuscripts\
  \ spanning over 150 years with line, character, year, and writer ground truth. \n\
  It further provides a set of unlabeled images for unsupervised or weakly-supervised\
  \ learning investigation. \nAs a baseline, a network that combines Convolutional\
  \ Neural Networks and bi-directional \\ac{LSTM} with a \\ac{CTC} (CNN/BLSTM/\\ac{CTC})\
  \ \\cite{7814068, Nina2018NephiA} was used, and it was shown that the \\ac{CER}\
  \ would be reduced in the presence of additional annotated data.\n "
