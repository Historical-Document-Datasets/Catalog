description: '

  The ESPOSALLES database \cite{ROMERO20131658} is a collection of ancient marriage
  license documents separated into the LICENSES and the INDEX subsets.

  A single-writer book written in old Catalan is the main content of the LICENSES
  set, and is comprised of 173 pages and 1,747 licenses.

  For every page, the subset includes the main text block bounding box, the text line
  within the text block coordinates, the license label, and the transcription for
  every line, word, and character in the main block.

  The INDEX subset, which includes 29 pages of the initial indexes of two volumes
  by a single writer created between 1491 and 1495.

  Similar to the LICENSES part, INDEX contains text and line layout as well as transcription
  annotations.

  Both subsets provide dataset splits for cross-validation.

  Finally, baseline results using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) \cite{Toselli2004IntegratedHR}
  and a BLSTM \cite{Graves2009855} with two feature sets, PRHLT \cite{Toselli2004IntegratedHR}
  and IAM \cite{10.5555/505741.505745}, showed the efficiency of neural networks with
  larger datasets for handwriting recognition.

  The database was further used in the ICDAR17 Competition on Information Extraction
  in Historical Handwritten Records \cite{8270158}.

  The aim there was to detect and assign name entities to semantic categories (name,
  surname, occupation, etc.) for two Tracks: Basic and Complete, which also contains
  the person (husband, wife, etc.).

  The team that obtained the highest average score with word-level segmentation used
  a ResNet-based unigram system for character recognition and named entity recognition,
  while with line-level segmentation, the best method used a RNN-LSTM with \ac{CTC}.'
