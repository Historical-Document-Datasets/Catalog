description: '

  Digital Peter \cite{10.1145/3476887.3476892} is a dataset of 9,694 images and their
  corresponding text from manuscripts, written by Peter the Great from 1709 to 1713
  for handwriting recognition.

  This dataset provides a 6,237 training, 1,930 validation, and 1,527 test splits
  that can be used either for line segmentation or line recognition.

  A competition\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sberbank-ai/digital\_peter\_aij2020}\label{digital_peter_note}}
  on text-line recognition was launched using this dataset.

  As a baseline, a 7-layer \ac{CNN} was used for image feature extraction and then
  a bidirectional GRU network with \ac{CTC} loss \cite{10.1145/1143844.1143891} was
  used to predict the image text.

  The model performance was further optimized using different hyperparameter values
  and beam search.

  The task was evaluated according to the \ac{CER}, the \ac{WER}, and the string \ac{acc}.'
