description: "\nThe ICFHR16 Competition \\cite{7814129} provided a collection of grayscale\
  \ Latin manuscript images for script type classification.\nTwo tasks were proposed\
  \ in this competition: Task 1, which uses a single label for each image, and Task\
  \ 2, which uses multi weighted labeling for each image. \nThe dataset is comprised\
  \ of 12 script classes and 3 sets, the training set contains 2K images and the test\
  \ sets for Tasks 1 and 2 contain 1K and 2K images, respectively. \nThe average \\\
  ac{acc} and the average intraclass distance were used for the evaluation of the\
  \ proposed systems. The system that achieved the highest accuracy for Task 1 used\
  \ I-vector extraction \\cite{Dehak2011LanguageRV} on image patches and a classification\
  \ of the extracted vectors using Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA). \nFor Task 2,\
  \ the best performing system in terms of Final Score utilized a neural network architecture\
  \ named DeepScript\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/mikekestemont/DeepScript}\\\
  label{deepscript}} and pre-processing to yield information on random image crops\
  \ and their various perturbations to the network classifier as input.\nIn terms\
  \ of the average intraclass distance, the higher ranked system in both tasks was\
  \ the FRDC-OCR and consisted of a \\ac{CNN} classifier that was applied on patches,\
  \ where for every image, the result is the average of the recognition confidence\
  \ and feature vector across its patches."
