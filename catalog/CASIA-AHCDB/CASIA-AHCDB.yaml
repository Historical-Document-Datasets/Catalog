description: "\nCASIA-AHCDB \\cite{8978010} is a database of 11,937 handwritten Chinese\
  \ document pages.\nFor the task of character recognition, the database provides\
  \ 2.2M handwritten characters belonging to 10,350 different classes.\nThe database\
  \ distributes these elements across two different datasets: (a) the Complete Library\
  \ in Four Sections (AHCDB - style1) and (b) the Ancient Buddhist Scriptures (AHCDB\
  \ - style2).\nThen, each dataset is split into a Basic Category Set (BC) for basic\
  \ character recognition, an Enhanced Category Set (EC) for open-set character recognition,\
  \ and a Reserved Category Set (RC) for other recognition purposes.\nTo benchmark\
  \ the database, a \\ac{CNN} \\cite{Zhang2017OnlineAO} and a Convolutional Prototype\
  \ Network (CPN) \\cite{Yang2018RobustCW} were used and experiments were performed\
  \ with only the \\textit{Basic Category Set} and with the combination of the \\\
  textit{Basic} and \\textit{Enhanced Category Sets} for every dataset. \nMoreover,\
  \ the transfer of information from the style1 to the style2 dataset with direct\
  \ train-test and fine-tuning was attempted, which performed best among the two methods."
