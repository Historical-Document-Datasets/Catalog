description: '

  The REID 2017 Competition \cite{8270161} held at ICDAR 2017 includes 26 evaluation
  images written in Bengali from 1785-1909 and an example set of 5 images for training.

  The competition originally held two tasks, the Bengali text recognition and the
  Quarterly Lists challenge (tabular recognition in English and Bengali); however,
  there were no submissions for the latter challenge.

  The organizers of the competition provided the image annotations in PAGE XML format
  \cite{5597587} created using Aletheia \cite{6065274}.

  These annotations included layout region polygons, metadata such as heading, paragraph,
  captions, footer, etc., and reading order information.

  %The competition hosted two tasks, layout analysis and OCR, but focuses mostly on
  Bengali text recognition.

  The Google Multilingual \ac{OCR} that uses the Google Cloud vision API \footnote{\url{https://cloud.google.com/vision/}\label{google}}
  achieved the highest flex \ac{ca} compared to the other submissions; however, the
  \ac{ca} of 75.4\% suggests that there is plenty of room for improvement.

  The same system, with a success rate of 78.4\%, outperformed the other systems on
  the text region segmentation task.'
