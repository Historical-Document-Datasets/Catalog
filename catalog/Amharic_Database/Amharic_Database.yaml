description: '

  The Amharic database \cite{8977980} presents a collection of 40,929 printed images
  with Amharic script text lines originating from pages of different documents written
  in Amharic and 296,403 synthetic images created using OCRopus \cite{Breuel2008TheOO}.

  The generated synthetic images include the Power Geez and the Visual Geez fonts.

  A Bidirectional \ac{LSTM} followed by a softmax function that produced 281 probability
  values, which is the number of unique characters in the database, and a \ac{CTC}
  output layer were proposed for text-line recognition.

  This method achieved an 8.54\% \ac{CER} for the printed Power Geez documents, 2.28\%
  \ac{CER} for the Visual Geez synthetic images and 4.24\% \ac{CER} for the Power
  Geez synthetic images.'
