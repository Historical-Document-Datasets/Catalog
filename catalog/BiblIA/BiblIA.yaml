description: '

  BiblIA \cite{10.1145/3476887.3476896} is a publicly available dataset of Medieval
  manuscripts written in Hebrew and Aramaic that contains 6 different scripts: Ashkenazi,
  Byzantine, Italian, Oriental, Sephardi, Yemenite.

  BiblIA contains more than 200 images with their corresponding annotations on baseline-
  and transcription-level, both focusing on the main text.

  Furthermore, a segmentation and recognition model based on kraken OCR is used for
  evaluation.

  The work presents \ac{acc} results on specific scripts (Ashkenazi, Italian, and
  Sephardi) and all scripts as well as training information.

  Further experimental results show the \ac{CER} and \ac{WER} on images not included
  in the test set.'
