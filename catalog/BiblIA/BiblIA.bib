    abstract = "This paper presents a new dataset of Peter the Great’s manuscripts and describes a segmentation procedure that converts initial images of documents into lines. This new dataset may be useful for researchers to train handwriting text recognition models as a benchmark when comparing different models. It consists of 9694 images and text files corresponding to different lines in historical documents. The open machine learning competition ”Digital Peter” was held based on the considered dataset. The baseline solution for this competition and advanced methods on handwritten text recognition are described in the article. The full dataset and all codes are publicly available.",

    abstract = "The paper presents Open Source generalized models for recognition and page segmentation, intended for use on the eScriptorium platform or kraken OCR engine, of Medieval Hebrew manuscripts in square script that arrive at a character accuracy of more than 97\\% on the validation set and a dataset consisting of 202 pages from almost 100 different literary manuscripts with layout annotation (regions and lines) as well as transcription. The manuscript pages are sourced from material in different script types, geographical, and chronological origins. In addition we describe the bootstrapping procedure that enabled us to create most of the dataset automatically through text-image alignment.",
