description: '

  IMPACT \cite{10.1145/2501115.2501130} is a large-scale dataset of over 600K images
  derived from different European libraries.

  The provided PAGE XML files \cite{5597587} contain the layout, reading order, and
  text transcription annotations for over 45K samples.

  This collection also offers metadata information, including bibliographic information,
  digitization information, physical characteristics, copyright information, administrative
  information, and comments.

  The dataset includes documents written in 18 different languages (Bulgarian, Catalan,
  Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Norwegian, Old Church
  Slavonic, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, and Spanish) and 10 scripts (Bohoriƒçica,
  Cyrillic, French, Gaj, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Latin/Gothic, Old Cyrillic, and Serif).

  A web interface provides access to the image samples and annotations, giving various
  options for the users to browse and search.

  This paper did not present any benchmark results for this dataset.'
