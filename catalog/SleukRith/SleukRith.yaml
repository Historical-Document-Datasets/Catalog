description: '

  SleukRith \cite{10.1145/3151509.3151510} is a dataset of 657 images from palm leaf
  manuscripts written in Khmer from 4 different sources.

  This dataset includes annotations for isolated character recognition and word and
  line segmentation.

  The most valuable aspect of this dataset is character recognition, which is the
  foundation for building the other two elements.

  The individual character images were constructed by cutting patches for every character
  and removing the noise of near characters using inpainting.

  For the rest of the annotations, the combination of the characters was used to determine
  the words and lines.

  To evaluate the set for character recognition, the \ac{CER} of a \ac{CNN}, which
  was 6.04\%, was presented.

  The dataset was further used in the ICFHR2018 Competition for Southeast Asian Palm
  Leaf Manuscripts presented in Section \ref{sssec:ICFHR18_ASIAN_PALM_LEAF}, which
  contained binarization, text-line segmentation, character recognition, and word
  transliteration tasks.

  However, this dataset was not part of the binarization task.

  The winning systems presented in the competition section also performed the best
  for this dataset alone.'
