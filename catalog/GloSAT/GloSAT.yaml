description: '

  GloSAT \cite{10.1145/3476887.3476890} is a table structure recognition dataset of
  500 archival images, printed, handwritten or mixed, of meteorological records.

  There are two types of ground truth in the dataset: individual cell and coarse segmentation
  cell annotations.

  In addition to the conventional XML cTDaR19 format annotations, the dataset provides
  the widely used Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) format \cite{Everingham2009ThePV}
  and extends these formats with cell information such as headers, page type, and
  table style.

  A benchmark evaluation of GloSAT (individual cell and coarse segmentation cell separately),
  cTDaR19, and their combination (+cTDaR19) using CascadeTabNet \cite{Prasad2020CascadeTabNetAA}
  and CascadeTabNet with additional postprocessing proposed by the authors was presented.

  This postprocessing step uses a 1-D DBSCAN clustering algorithm \cite{10.1145/3068335}
  to infer vertical and horizontal lines of a table, assuming that only a subset of
  cells is needed to place the rest for a rectangular table.

  The results on the \ac{WA} F1 score showed that postprocessing helps the performance
  in all experimental cases.'
