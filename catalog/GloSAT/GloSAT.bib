    abstract = "Understanding and extracting tables from documents is a research problem that has been studied for decades. Table structure recognition is the labelling of components within a detected table, which can be detected automatically or manually provided. This paper presents the GloSAT historical measurement table dataset designed to train table structure recognition models for use in downstream historical data rescue applications. The dataset contains 500 scanned and manually annotated images of pages from meteorological measurement logbooks. We enhance standard full table and individual cell annotations by adding additional annotations for headings, headers, and table bodies. We also provide annotations for coarse segmentation cells consisting of multiple data cells logically grouped by ruling lines of ink or whitespace in the table, which often represent data cells that are semantically grouped. Our dataset annotations are provided in VOC2007 and ICDAR-2019 Competition on Table Detection and Recognition (cTDaR-19) XML formats, and our dataset can easily be aggregated with the cTDaR-19 dataset. We report results running a series of benchmark algorithms on our new dataset, concluding that post-processing is very important for performance, and that page style is not as significant a feature as table type on model performance.",

    abstract = "At SIGMOD 2015, an article was presented with the title “DBSCAN Revisited: Mis-Claim, Un-Fixability, and Approximation” that won the conference’s best paper award. In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.",
