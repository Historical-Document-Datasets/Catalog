description: '

  The Hugin-Munin dataset \cite{10.1007/978-3-031-06555-2_27} is the first handwritten
  recognition dataset for text written in Norwegian.

  This dataset contains images derived from diaries and private correspondences written
  from 1820 to 1950 from 12 different writers.

  The ground truth includes the transcriptions of 164,922 words or 23,732 lines in
  PAGE XML format.

  The authors provide a 80\% training - 10\% validation - 10\% test random split and
  another split with 3 unseen writers in the test set.

  They further present a survey of open-source handwritten text recognition libraries
  used since 2019 and compare the performance using the \ac{CER} and \ac{WER} on the
  random split data.

  The lowest \ac{CER} is obtained using PyLaia \cite{puigcerver2018pylaia}, while
  the lowest \ac{WER} is obtained using Kaldi \cite{Arora2019UsingAM}.

  These best methods were further deployed on the writer split and achieve much lower
  performance than the random split. '
