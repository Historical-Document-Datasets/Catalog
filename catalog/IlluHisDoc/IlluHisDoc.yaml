description: '

  In \cite{monnier2020docExtractor}, a test set of Gallica images named IlluHisDoc
  was presented for segmentation generalizability purposes.

  This set was split into four types of documents: (a) printed documents with drawings,
  photos, ornaments, and paintings; and manuscripts that contain (b) scientific graphs,
  (c) illuminations, and (d) drawings.

  Moreover, a segmentation method based on a ResNet-18 \cite{He2016DeepRL} backbone
  encoder-decoder architecture was proposed.

  The performance of this model was compared with the performance of Tesseract4\footref{tesseract}
  and Mask-RCNN \cite{he2017mask} using pre-training either on the synthetic dataset
  PubLayNet \cite{zhong2019publaynet} or on SynDoc, a 10K image synthetic corpus created
  for this study.

  The proposed method pretrained on SynDoc outperformed the other methods according
  to the \ac{mIoU} results.'
