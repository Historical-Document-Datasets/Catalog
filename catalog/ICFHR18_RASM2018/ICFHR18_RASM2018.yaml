description: "\nThe RASM 2018 competition \\cite{8583806} was part of ICFHR 2018 and\
  \ targeted the recognition of Arabic historical scientific manuscripts through three\
  \ tasks: page segmentation, text-line detection, and \\ac{OCR}. \nAn example set\
  \ of 15 single-column page images with PAGE XML ground truth format \\cite{5597587}\
  \ was provided for training and 85 for evaluation to handle these tasks.\nAs in\
  \ similar competitions, the ground truth included polygon regions, text transcriptions,\
  \ and metadata for each region, such as headings, paragraphs, captions, footers,\
  \ and reading order.\nFor system evaluation, the competition used the success rate\
  \ and errors for the page and text-line segmentation predictions and the \\ac{ca}\
  \ for the \\ac{OCR}.\nFor page segmentation, the winning system used an \\ac{FCN}\
  \ applied on extracted patches.\nThe page layout predictions were further cropped\
  \ for the text-line segmentation, which was performed at pixel-level using anisotropic\
  \ Gaussian smoothing. \nThe highest performance was achieved for the rest of the\
  \ tasks by a Historical Arabic Handwritten/Typewritten \\ac{OCR} system framework.\n\
  This system can handle various fonts and layouts, and in the case of the competition,\
  \ an instance-based segmentation on extracted lines was performed."
