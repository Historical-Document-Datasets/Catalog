description: '

  The work presented in \cite{8978117} introduces a method for layout and page sub-division
  that groups text-lines into semantic objects.

  In order to evaluate the proposed method, they use the ABP dataset (ABP small) \cite{8395184}
  and they further introduce and extension of it, ABP large, and the National Archive
  Finland (NAF) dataset.

  ABP small, ABP large, and NAF contain 180, 1,098, and 488 pages, respectively, and
  were used for table rows, columns, and cells segmentation, where the F1 measure
  is reported, and shows the most promising results in the cell partition.'
