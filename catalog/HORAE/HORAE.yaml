description: "\nThe HORAE dataset \\cite{10.1145/3352631.3352633} contains 557 images\
  \ derived from books of hours and their corresponding layout and text-related annotations.\n\
  These images originate from the full HORAE corpus, which consists of 500 manuscripts\
  \ and 107,227 pages.\nTo create the final HORAE dataset with the annotated pages,\
  \ a selection pipeline was used that initially classified pages into the following\
  \ classes: binding, white page, calendar, miniature, miniature-and-text, text-with-miniature,\
  \ and full-page text.\nThey excluded the ones that were binding or white pages and\
  \ kept two images per class.\nThen, the filtered pages were clustered from the initial\
  \ step to keep one from every class and detect the ones considered outliers because\
  \ of their rare layout. \nFor the final 557 image set, the centroids from the most\
  \ frequent layouts and the strongest outliers were annotated.\nA PAGE XML \\cite{5597587}\
  \ file accompanies every image of the final set with annotations for page, miniature,\
  \ border elements, initials, and other decorations found in the text body, such\
  \ as line filler, music notations, and ornaments. \nBenchmark results were presented\
  \ for line detection and layout analysis using the dhSegment segmentation neural\
  \ network \\cite{Oliveira2018dhSegmentAG} and evaluated according to the IoU with\
  \ different thresholds and postprocessing."
