description: '

  The latest of the DIBCO competition series of 2019 \cite{8978205} aimed in evaluating
  various systems for the task of image binarization.

  The series of this competition initiated in 2009 \cite{5277767} and had several
  rounds for printed and handwritten document images \cite{8270159, 6628857, 6065249}.

  The 2019 competition included two categories, CATEGORY I, that provided 10 historical
  handwritten and printed test images of the \nth{19} century, and CATEGORY II, that
  provided 10 test images derived from papyri of various places in Egypt.

  For CATEGORY I, the best performing method used noise reduction and then an ensemble
  of three clustering algorithms (Fuzzy C-Means, K-Medoids and K-Means++) for the
  step of grouping the foreground and background of the input images.

  The best performing system for CATEGORY II, used the neural network architecture
  LadderNet \cite{Zhuang2018LadderNetMN} on $48\times48$ image patches.

  All systems were evaluated using \ac{FM}, pseudo-\ac{FM} ($F_{ps}$), PSNR, and Distance
  Reciprocal Distortion Metric (DRD).'
