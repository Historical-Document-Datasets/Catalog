description: '

  Another competition, which is similar to the ICDAR17 Historical-WI (Section \ref{sssec:Historical-WI})
  and the ICDAR2019-HDRC-IR (Section \ref{sssec:ICDAR2019-HDRC-IR}) is the HisFragIR20
  \cite{Seuret2020ICFHR2C}.

  This competition further increased the size of the dataset by generating 120K fragments,
  randomly shaped and rectangular, from 20K documents and 9.8K writers.

  The test data come from European Middle Age books (\nth{9} to \nth{15} century CE).

  Fragments extracted from the ICDAR2019-HDRC-IR test set comprise the training set.

  The competition evaluated the test set for two tasks, retrieval per writer and per
  image.

  For the writer task, the best system in terms of \ac{mAP} used a ResNet \cite{He2016DeepRL}
  with 20 layers trained on SIFT keypoints and multi-\ac{VLAD} encoding, PCA for descriptor
  dimensionality reduction, k-means clustering on the descriptors, and cosine similarity
  for the final results.

  The whole process was based on the work presented in \cite{christlein2017unsupervised}.

  Accuracy, Pr@10, and Pr@100 metrics were used.

  The system that achieved the highest values used a ResNet50 \cite{He2016DeepRL}
  feature extractor with whole fragment image input and the $\chi^2$ distance.

  This system also obtained the highest values in all retrieval per image task metrics.'
