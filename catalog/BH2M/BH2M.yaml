description: '

  The Barcelona Historical Handwritten Marriages Database or BH2M \cite{6976764} consists
  of 174 handwritten marriage record pages, where 100 pages are meant for training,
  34 for validation, and 40 for testing.

  The included pages were written in Old Catalan by a single writer between 1617 and
  1619 and preserved in the Barcelona central archives.

  The database provides the ground truth for layout analysis, text transcription,
  and semantic analysis.

  XML annotation files are organized hierarchically into text blocks, segmented lines,
  and text words for layout analysis.

  The additional word transcriptions and semantics about the license, appearance order,
  date, and information about the wife and husband, may enable handwritten text recognition,
  word spotting, information extraction and understanding and context-aware algorithms.

  Moreover, baseline results of line segmentation \cite{Mota2014AGA} using the \ac{DR},
  \ac{RA}, and \ac{FM} metrics, and segmentation-free \cite{Vinciarelli2002OfflineCW}
  and -based \cite{Almazn2012EfficientEW} word spotting algorithms using the \ac{mAP}
  were presented.'
