description: '

  HisClima \cite{9412210} is a database of handwritten weather ship log book pages
  from 1880 to 1881 that contains both layout annotations of blocks, columns, rows,
  and lines and transcription annotations with relevant information such as number
  of cells in the tables.

  The dataset comprises 208 pages with tables and 211 pages with descriptive text.

  Baseline experiments are performed for text recognition, line segmentation, and
  information extraction.

  A CRNN  with CTC loss performing on line images was used for the recognition task
  with and without a language model (LM) and evaluated according to the \ac{WER} and
  \ac{CER}.

  The neural network architecture presented in \cite{Quirs2018MultiTaskHD}, that performs
  geometric and logical layout analysis, was used for the task of line segmentation.

  Finally, for the information extraction for cell position and line geometry an information
  retrieval on tables method without segmentation based in \cite{8563224} was used.

  The two latter tasks were evaluated according to precision, recall, and F1 scores.'
