description: '

  This dataset \cite{10.1145/3352631.3352640} contains a set of 35,623 images for
  font classification and consists of 12 different classes: Antiqua, Italic, Textura,
  Rotunda, Gotico-Antiqua, Bastarda, Schwabacher, Fraktur, Greek, Hebrew, "Other Fonts"
  and "Not a Font".

  Several of the data samples have multiple labels, thus this dataset is appropriate
  for testing multilabel classification methods.

  This dataset is considered highly imbalanced.

  Baseline results on ResNet with 50 and 18 layers \cite{He2016DeepRL}, VGG with 16
  layers \cite{Simonyan2015VeryDC}, and DenseNet with 121 layers \cite{huang2018densely}
  were presented, and the \ac{mIoU} metric was reported.

  This dataset was further used on the Historical Document Classification Competition
  \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-86337-1_41} that was part of the \nth{16} \ac{ICDAR} 2021.

  Further information about this competition is presented in \ref{sssec:his_doc_classification_icdar_2021}.'
