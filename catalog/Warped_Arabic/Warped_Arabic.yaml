description: "\nIn \\cite{iet:/content/conferences/10.1049/cp.2018.1286}, a dataset\
  \ of 200 historical Arabic document images from the 16th to the 19th century and\
  \ four different libraries was introduced. \nThe images were derived from books,\
  \ newspapers, legal documents, and journals and contain a variety of layouts and\
  \ states of degradation that help in facing challenges in baseline detection and\
  \ text-line segmentation tasks. \nThe PAGE XML ground truth \\cite{5597587} contains\
  \ text line-level information and metadata information according to bibliographic\
  \ knowledge (author, title, date, location, document type, and page number), physical\
  \ properties (language, script, font, and number of columns), and copyright data.\
  \ \nResults were shown for text-line segmentation using four methods: Voronoi diagrams,\
  \ a smearing method, a hybrid approach, and a projection profile-based method. \n\
  For these methods, three warping percentages were utilized: 0\\%, 25\\%, and 50\\\
  %. \nThe results suggested that the Voronoi diagrams achieved the highest success\
  \ rate. Finally, the more warped the text lines are, the more challenging the task\
  \ is. \nThus, the performance decreases as the curvature increases."
