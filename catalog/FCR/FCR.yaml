  The FCR dataset \cite{Quirs2020FinnishCR} includes 500 pages from the Renovated
  District Court

  Records of Finland from the \nth{19} century.

  The images are both single- or double-page which makes the dataset quite complex
  and the corresponding ground truth contains annotations on baseline- and layout-level.

  The layout regions included are: page number, marginalia, paragraph, paragraph2,
  table, and table2.

  The ground truth further includes the line-level transcriptions in the Swedish language.'
