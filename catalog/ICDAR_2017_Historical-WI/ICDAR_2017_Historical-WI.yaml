description: '

  The Historical-WI competition \cite{8270156} focused on image retrieval based on
  writer identification.

  The competition offered a set of 3,600 images of handwritten document pages ranging
  from the \nth{13} to the \nth{20} century for evaluation.

  The test set originated from the Universitätsbibliothek Basel and included 720 different
  writers.

  For training, 1,182 images in color and binary format from 394 writers were provided
  and were different from the writers in the test set.

  The submitted systems were evaluated using the \ac{mAP} metric.

  The system that achieved the highest \ac{mAP} used feature vectors derived from
  binarized samples and the concatenation of their oriented Basic Image Feature (BIFs)
  columns histograms \cite{7490135,NEWELL20142255}.'
