description: '

  The Bold-Italic-Regular (BIR) database \cite{10.1145/3476887.3476913} consists of
  printed historical document pages with word bounding boxes and three font classes
  (bold, italic, and regular) meant for word detection and font style classification.

  The BIR database includes 285 scanned pages from various catalogues from the \nth{19}
  and \nth{20} centuries written in French, Latin, or other languages.

  Baseline results using 50\% training, 25\% validation, and 25\% test random splits
  (TVT), and a 5-fold cross-validation (CV5) were presented.

  For word detection, YOLOv5m was utilized \cite{glenn_jocher_2021_4418161}, and for
  style classification, MobileNetV2 \cite{sandler2019mobilenetv2} and Xception \cite{chollet2017xception}
  were utilized.

  All models were evaluated according to the F1 score.

  The MobileNetV2 style classification results were also compared with the results
  of a human expert on 1K randomly chosen words.

  The results showed a similar performance between the model and the human expert.
