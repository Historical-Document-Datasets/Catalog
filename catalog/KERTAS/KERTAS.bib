    abstract = "As suggested by modern paleography, the width of ink traces is a powerful source of information for off-line writer identification, particularly if combined with its direction. Such measurements can be computed using simple, fast and accurate methods based on pixel contours, the combination of which forms a powerful feature for writer identification: the Quill feature. It is a probability distribution of the relation between the ink direction and the ink width. It was tested in writer identification experiments on two datasets of challenging medieval handwriting and two datasets of modern handwriting. The feature achieved a nearest-neighbor accuracy in the range of 63–95\\%, which even approaches the performance of two state-of-the-art features in contemporary-writer identification (Hinge and Fraglets). The feature is intuitive and explainable and its principle is supported by a model of trace production by a quill. It illustrates that ink width patterns are valuable. A slightly more complex variant of Quill, QuillHinge, scored 70–97\\% writer identification accuracy. The features are already being used by domain experts using a graphical interface."

    abstract = "This paper presents a text-independent writer recognition method in a multi-script environment. Handwritten texts in Greek and English are considered in this study. The objective is to recognize the writer of a handwritten text in one script from the samples of the same writer in another script and hence validate the hypothesis that writing style of an individual remains constant across different scripts. Another interesting aspect of our study is the use of short handwritten texts which was implied to resemble the real life scenarios where the forensic experts, in general, find only short pieces of texts to identify a given writer. The proposed method is based on a set of run-length features which are compared with the well-known state-of-the-art features. Classification is carried out using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The experimental results obtained on a database of 126 writers with 4 samples per writer show that the proposed scheme achieves interesting performances on writer identification and verification in a multi-script environment.",
