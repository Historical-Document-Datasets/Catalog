description: '

  PHTD \cite{6121553} is a 140-page dataset of handwritten documents in the Persian
  language.

  The dataset includes 1,787 text-lines and 27,073 words for text recognition and
  word and line segmentation tasks.

  For the former task, a unicode text file is included for every page, and for the
  latter, a pixel-labeled file is provided as the ground truth.

  Two algorithms were utilized for the task of text-line segmentation.

  The Potential Piece-wise Separation Line (PPSL) method \cite{10.1007/s10044-011-0226-x}
  obtained an 89.43\% segmentation accuracy, while the other method proposed by Alaei
  et al. \cite{Alaei2011ANS}, outperformed PPSL with an accuracy of 94\%.

  In both methods, each document was split vertically into stripes. '
