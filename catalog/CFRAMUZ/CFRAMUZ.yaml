description: '

  The CFRAMUZ dataset \cite{Arvanitopoulos2017AHF} includes grayscale image pages
  from handwritten novels by Charles Ferdinand Ramuz in French between 1910 and 1946.

  Text and XML annotation files contain the unique word ID, coordinates, width and
  height of word bounding boxes, word line number, word number in the current line,
  and word transcription for word spotting without segmentation purposes.

  The following methods were evaluated according to Precision-Recall curves: Word
  Spotting and Recognition with Embedded Attributes (EAWS) \cite{6857995}, Efficient
  Exemplar Word Spotting (EEWS) \cite{Almazn2012EfficientEW}, Bag-of-Visual-Words
  Word Spotting (BoVWWS) \cite{Rusiol2011BrowsingHD}, and Fisher Kernels Word Spotting
  (FKWS) \cite{5277774}.

  The \ac{mAP} of these algorithms were compared on the introduced datasets with the
  performance on the George Washington (GW) and the Lord Byron (LB) datasets.

  Although this is a single-writer dataset, some variation in terms of writing style
  occured due to the year range.

  Therefore, additional experiments using splits according to style were conducted.'
