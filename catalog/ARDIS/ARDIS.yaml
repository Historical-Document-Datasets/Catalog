description: "\nArkiv Digital Sweden (ARDIS) \\cite{kusetogullari2020ardis} is a handwritten\
  \ digit dataset collection derived from historical church records. \nARDIS contains\
  \ four different datasets: \\textit{Dataset I}, which contains 10K 4-digit string\
  \ images that represent a year, \\textit{Dataset II}, which contains single digits\
  \ of classes 0-9, \\textit{Dataset III}, which is the same as \\textit{Dataset II}\
  \ but is cleansed from noise, and \\textit{Dataset IV}, which is the same as \\\
  textit{Dataset III} but is in grayscale and is similar to the highly used MNIST\
  \ Database \\cite{lecun1998mnist}.\n\\textit{Dataset II - IV} contain 7,600 digit\
  \ images.\nSeveral experiments using CNN, SVM, HOG+SVM, k-NN, random forest, and\
  \ RNN classifiers were presented. \nThe results of training using the MNIST and\
  \ USPS \\cite{291440} datasets and testing on ARDIS reveal the diversity of the\
  \ ARDIS dataset as the highest \\ac{RA} obtained reaches $58.80\\%$, while training\
  \ and testing on ARDIS gives a performance of $98.6\\%$.\nIn all experimental cases,\
  \ the best performance was achieved by the \\ac{CNN} digit classifier."
