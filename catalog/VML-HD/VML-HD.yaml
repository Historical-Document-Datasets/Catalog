  VML-HD \cite{8067751} is a database of Arabic handwritten documents that includes
  680 pages from 5 different books of different writers.

  This database can be used for handwriting recognition and word-spotting.

  The annotations of the dataset include the book and page number, the segment id,
  bounding box coordinates for 121,636 sub-words and 244,553 characters, length of
  subword, and Arabic and Latin symbol transcriptions in Hadara XML format.

  Word spotting results using Radial Descriptor \cite{6981050} and Radial Descriptor
  Graph \cite{7814035} on a subset from every book and the 5 books combined were presented.

  The Top1 - Top5 \ac{DR} of the Radial Descriptor Graph method showed better performance
  on the combined set than the Radial Descriptor.'
