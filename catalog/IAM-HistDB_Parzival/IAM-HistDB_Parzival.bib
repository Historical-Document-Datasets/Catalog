    abstract = "Handwriting recognition in historical documents is vital for the creation of digital libraries. The creation of readily available ground truth data plays a central role for the development of new recognition technologies. For historical documents, ground truth creation is more difficult and time-consuming when compared with modern documents. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic ground truth creation proceeding for historical documents that takes into account noisy background and transcription alignment. The proposed ground truth creation is demonstrated for the IAM Historical Handwriting Database (IAM-HistDB) that is currently under construction and will include several hundred Old German manuscripts. With a small set of algorithmic tools and few manual interactions, it is shown how laypersons can efficiently create a ground truth for handwriting recognition.",

    abstract = "Transcriptions of historical documents are a valuable source for extracting labeled handwriting images that can be used for training recognition systems. In this paper, we introduce the Saint Gall database that includes images as well as the transcription of a Latin manuscript from the 9th century written in Carolingian script. Although the available transcription is of high quality for a human reader, the spelling of the words is not accurate when compared with the handwriting image. Hence, the transcription poses several challenges for alignment regarding, e.g., line breaks, abbreviations, and capitalization. We propose an alignment system based on character Hidden Markov Models that can cope with these challenges and efficiently aligns complete document pages. On the Saint Gall database, we demonstrate that a considerable alignment accuracy can be achieved, even with weakly trained character models.",

The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity.",

    abstract = "Handwritten word-spotting is traditionally viewed as an image matching task between one or multiple query word-images and a set of candidate word-images in a database. This is a typical instance of the query-by-example paradigm. In this article, we introduce a statistical framework for the word-spotting problem which employs hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model keywords and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for score normalization. We explore the use of two types of HMMs for the word modeling part: continuous HMMs (C-HMMs) and semi-continuous HMMs (SC-HMMs), i.e. HMMs with a shared set of Gaussians. We show on a challenging multi-writer corpus that the proposed statistical framework is always superior to a traditional matching system which uses dynamic time warping (DTW) for word-image distance computation. A very important finding is that the SC-HMM is superior when labeled training data is scarce-as low as one sample per keyword-thanks to the prior information which can be incorporated in the shared set of Gaussians.",
