description: '

  This competition \cite{8977999} presented a database of approximately 10K historical
  Chinese family record pages to evaluate systems for the tasks of (1) text recognition
  on extracted lines, (2) pixel-level layout analysis, and (3) text-line detection
  and recognition.

  More specifically, the training set includes 11,715 pages derived from 37 different
  books along with their PAGE XML \cite{5597587} and pixel-wise annotations, while
  the test set includes 1,135 images from 12 books.

  To evaluate the submitted systems, Task 1 uses the edit distance (editDistance),
  Task 2 uses the \ac{mIoU}, and Task 3 uses the total counted errors (totalErrors)
  of the output XML file.

  The team that achieved the best results for all tasks used a Convolutional Recurrent
  Neural Network (CRNN) \cite{Shi2017AnET} to recognize Chinese text, a Cascade R-CNN
  \cite{Cai2018CascadeRD} to detect text lines, and a U-Net-shaped network for the
  pixel-wise classification.

  For Task 2, the system that outperformed the others achieved a 99.96\% IoU for the
  background class and 99.24\% for the text class.'
